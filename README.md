# Deep Learning-Based Homography and Camera Position Estimator

The following is the project flow:

1. Create a Deep Learning based model to estimate the homography for 2 given images.
2. Create an algorithm that can effectively estimate the camera pose RLL.
3. Use pymatbridge to plot the camera pos
